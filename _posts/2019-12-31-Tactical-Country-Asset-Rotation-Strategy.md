title: Tactical Country Asset Rotation Strategy
---

The working research is inspired by my first project at TrimTabs which I implemented a Tactical Asset Allocation Strategy based on the paper my mentor Mr. Ted Theodore jointly wrote and published in the Journal of Investment Management: [What is Value in an Equity Market](https://www.joim.com/what-is-value-in-an-equity-market/)

In this post I discuss a tactical asset allocation strategy using country equity ETFs by analyzing macroeconomics factors, stock market price momentum and market valuation level.
