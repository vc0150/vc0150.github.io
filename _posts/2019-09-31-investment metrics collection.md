title: Investment Metrics Collection
---

This post collects investment metrics I have learned over the year and I organize the metrics based on the framework presented by Marc Odo at Swan Global Investment: [New Risk Metrics for a New World](https://www.swanglobalinvestments.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/white-paper-new-risk-metrics-for-a-new-world-swan-global-investments.pdf).

- Volatility Risk
The compounding characteristic of investment returns implies volatility as a source of risk due to the calculation of geometric average. With the same arithemetic average, investment performances with lower volatility reward investor the more. In the meantime, the consistency of return also reduces the risk of market timing.

- Benchmark Risk

- Capital Preservation Risk

- Tail Risk
