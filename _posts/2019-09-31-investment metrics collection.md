This post collects investment metrics I have learned over the years which I used to evaluate investment strategies. A link to this Jupyter Notebook shows the implementations with Python with NumPy and Pandas.

### Volatility Risk

The compounding characteristic of investment returns implies volatility as a source of risk due to the calculation of geometric average. With the same arithemetic average, investment performances with lower volatility reward investor the more. In the meantime, the consistency of return also reduces the risk of market timing.
