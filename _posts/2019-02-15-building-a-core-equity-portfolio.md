title: Building a Core Equity Portfolio
---

This post summarizes my understanding of the principal investment strategy on building a core equity position for long-term capital appreciation. In the future, I will write more details about the systematic implementations and document relevant research.

##### Investment Objective: Long-term capital appreciation
##### Investment Vehicle: Equity Portfolio (Long Only)

I believe a systematic implementation in seeking high-quality companies will reward investors in the long-term. Start with a bottom-up approach, my goal is to build an all-season equity portfolio with strong and consistent alpha generation against the broad market index, except for recovery stage of the market when all the "value" (junk) stocks tend to outperform. With the top down analysis, I seek better performance with active asset allocation decision (applying leverage or asset rotation).

##### Bottom-up approach:

The bottom-up security selection process is the foundation of building the core equity portfolio. In order to build a core position, we need to identify high-quality names regardless of the business conditions. The following measurements either in qualitative or quantitative are the keys in my security selection process.

Qualitative Summary:
- Strong or fast-growing brand recognition
- Sustainable competitive advantage
- Healthy financial condition
- Responsible corporate governance

Quantitative Measurement:
- Strong current profitability
  - Cash flow return on investment and trend
- Sustainable profitability that persists into the future
  - Earning with low accruals
  - Earning Variability
- Moderate comparable valuation metrics
  - EBITDA/Enterprise Value
  - Free cash flow yields
- Solid balance sheet
  - Net Debt/Total Assets
  - Cash Interests/Cash
  - Shareholder's Equity
- Healthy revenue generation
  - Revenue Growth
- Avoid extreme moments on stock return
  - Momentum
  - Volatility (Covariance, beta)
  - Skewness (Coskewness)
  - Kurtosis
 - Avoid Long-lasting Negative Investor Sentiment
  - Stock News Sentiment

##### Top-down approach:

While bottom-up security is the foundation of my investment process, the economic condition is the foundation of market return in the long run (normally the economics indicator is lagging, however, as my mentor Mr. Ted Theodore said: Not every bear market comes with recession, but every bear market comes with a bear market). Furthermore, active asset allocation decision in country and sector can be better achieved with top-down analysis.
