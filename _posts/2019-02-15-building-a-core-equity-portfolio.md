title: Building a Core Equity Portfolio
---

This post summarizes my understanding of the principle investment strategy on building a core equity position for long-term capital appreciation. In the future I will write more details about the systematic implementations and document relevant research.

##### Investment Objective: Long-term capital appreciation
##### Investment Vehicle: Equity Portfolio (Long Only)

I believe a systematic implementation in seeking high-quality companies will reward investors in the long-term. Start with a bottom up approach, my goal is to build a all-season equity portfolio with strong and consistent alpha generation against the broad market index, except for recovery stage of the market when all the "value" (junk) stocks tend to outperform. With top down analysis, I seek better performance with active asset allocation decision (applying leverage or asset rotation).

##### Bottom up approach:

The bottom up security selection process is the foudation of building the core equity portfolio. In order to build a core position, we need to identify high quality names regardless of the business conditions. The following measurements either in qualitative or quantitative are the keys in my security selection process.

Qualitative Measurement:
- Strong brand recognition
- Sustainable competitive advantage

Quantitative Measurement:
- Strong current profitability
- Sustainable profitability that persists into the future
- Moderate comparable valuation metrics
- Solid balance sheet
- Strong and improving profit margin
- Low moment risk on stock return

##### Top down approach:

While bottom up security is the foundation of my investment process, the economics condition is the foundation to market return in the long run (normally the economics indicator are lagging, however, as my mentor Mr. Ted Theodore said: Not every bear market comes with recession, but every bear market comes with a bear market). Furthermore, active asset allocation decision in country and sector can be better achieved with top down analysis.
