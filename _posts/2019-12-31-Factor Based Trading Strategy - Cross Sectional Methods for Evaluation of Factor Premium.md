title: Factor Based Trading Strategy - Cross Sectional Methods for Evaluation of Factor Premium
---

In this post we discuss common cross sectional methods for evaluating factor premium, and how machine learning apporach can help improve the traditional methods.

- Portfolio Sorts

The goal of this particular test is to determine whether a factor earns sysematic premium, by grouping together securities with similar characterstics (factors). For example, we can group stocks market capitalization (size factor) from smallest to largest, such that each portfolio contains stocks with similar market capitalization. The next step is to calculate and evaluate different investment metrics* (See [Investment Metrics Collections](http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/)) of these portfolios.

- Factor Models

- Factor Portfolios

- Information Coefficients
